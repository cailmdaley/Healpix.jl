# Map functions

Functions like [`pix2angNest`](@ref) and [`ang2pixNest`](@ref) fully
define the Healpix tessellation scheme. They are however extremely
impractical in a number of situations. It happens often that a large
fraction of pixels in a map need to be processed together. Healpix.jl
introduces the [`Map{T, O <: Order}`](@ref) type, which acts as a
collection of all the pixels on the sphere. A `Map` type holds the
value of all the pixels in its `pixels` field, and it keeps track of
the ordering (either `RING` or `NESTED`). Here is an example that
shows how to create a map and initialize it:

```julia
nside = 32
m = Map{Float64, Ring}(nside)
m.pixels[:] = 1.0  # Set all pixels to 1
```

Healpix.jl defines the basic operations on maps (sum, subtraction,
multiplication, division). These operations can either combine two
maps or a map and a scalar value:

```julia
mollweide(m * 2.0)
mollweide(m * m)
```

The [`Map{T, O <: Order}`](@ref) is derived from the abstract type
[`GenericMap{T}`](@ref), which does not encode the ordering. It is useful for
functions that can either work on ring/nested-ordered maps but cannot be
executed on plain generic arrays:

```julia
# Return the number of pixels in the map, regardless of its ordering
maplength(m::GenericMap{T}) where T = length(m)

# This returns 12
maplength(Map{Float64, Ring}(1))

# This too returns 12
maplength(Map{Float64, Nest}(1))

# This fails
maplength(zeros(Float64, 12))
```

```

## Encoding the order

Healpix.jl distinguishes between `RING` and `NEST` orderings using
Julia's typesystem. The abstract type `Order` has two descendeants,
`Ring` and `Nest`, which are used to instantiate objects
of type `Map`.

```@docs
Order
Ring
Nest
```

## Pixel functions

When working with maps, it is not needed to pick between
[`ang2pixNest`](@ref) and [`ang2pixRing`](@ref) because a `Map` type
already encodes the ordering. Functions `pix2ang` and `ang2pix` always
choose the correct ordering, but they require a `Map` instead of a
[`Resolution`](@ref) as their first argument.

```@docs
pix2ang
ang2pix
```

## Loading and saving maps

Healpix.jl implements a number of functions to save maps in FITS files.

```@docs
saveToFITS
```

Function `savePixelsToFITS` is a low-level function. It knows nothing
about the ordering schema used for the pixels, so the caller should
manually write the `ORDERING` keyword in the HDU header by itself.

```@docs
savePixelsToFITS
```

To load a map from a FITS file, you can use `readMapFromFITS`.

```@docs
readMapFromFITS
```

## Testing for conformability

It often happens that two Healpix maps need to be combined together:
for instance, pixels on a sky map might need to be masked using a sky
mask, or one map might need to be subtracted from another
one. «Conformability» means that the operation between the two maps
can be done directly on the pixels, without oordering or resolution
conversions. The function `conformables` checks this.

```@repl
using Healpix # hide
m1 = Map{Float64, Ring}(1)
m2 = Map{Float64, Ring}(1)
m3 = Map{Float64, Nest}(1)
m4 = Map{Float64, Nest}(2)
conformables(m1, m2)
conformables(m1, m3)
conformables(m1, m4)
```

```@docs
conformables
```

## Map-making

Map-making is the process of converting a time series of measurements
into a sky map. The most basic form of map-making is the so-called
"binning", where samples in the time stream falling within the same
sky pixel are averaged. This map-making algorithm is strictly accurate
only if the noise in the time stream is white.

Healpix.jl implements two functions to perform binning,
[`tod2map`](@ref) and [`combinemaps!`](@ref).

```@docs
tod2map
combinemaps!
```
